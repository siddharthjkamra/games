<h3>Selection of JAR</h3>

<p>Since there are multiple versions of a game. You might get confuse that which version you should use. Let me clear you something, We all have been using large screen devices so any version we can run now but I only uploaded maximum available screen versions of games so that you could get most possible quality. I recommend 240x320 as a standard version and 480x800 as touch screen version. There are also available device based version, now it's upto you which version you choose. Thanks!</p><br>
<p>Example screen sizes:</p>

<b>240x320</b><br>
<img src="../assets/example_240x320.jpg" alt="Example 240x320 Size Image" width="150px"></img>
<br>
<b>800x480</b><br>
<img src="../assets/example_800x480.jpg" alt="Example 800x480 Size Image" width="200px"></img>
